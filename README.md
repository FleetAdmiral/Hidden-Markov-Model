# Hidden-Markov-Model
Use Brown corpus by importing from nltk http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html#chunked-corpora (Even though they have a tagged corpus, you don't need it, use raw only)

Train it on the given unlabelled corpus with tags as "tag1", "tag2", ...."tag10" with random initial parameters. Present Top hundred words for each tag (by top, we mean the most probable words this tag could "emit"). Document in your report any interesting observations you can make from the word groups you just made,  Can we find some groups to be linguistically similar or important?

Do a 10 fold validation with different random initialization.
